cd - Change directory, these command to use  to change working directory
Syntax : cd [directory name]

In the above example directory name mentioned as /home/ajeya/Document and once we click on the enter button the path is enrouted to Document folder which we can see in the next command line.
Similarly if we want to enroute to Home directory we need to use cd [blank space ] or cd ~ or cd home directory path (/home/user name). We can see it in the below example

For root directory we can use cd '/' to enroute the root directory
If we want to enroute the parent  or we want to enroute previous file (1 step back), we can use cd .. command
If we want to enroute 2 step back, We can use cd ../.. command
If we want to enroute the file which has space in the file name , we can use the following  commands. Let us assume that the file name is file 1, then                                                                                                                              cd 'file 1'            or                 cd file\ 1           or        cd "file 1"
