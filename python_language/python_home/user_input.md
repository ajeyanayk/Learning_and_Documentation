We are able to Enter the input using input()
Eg: 	x=input("Enter Your name: ")
		print(x) # it shows the content which we typed after execution
	
	#which display as 
	Enter username:

If we are using python version which is less than 3.6, we need to use raw_input().
Eg:		username = raw_input("Enter username:")
			print("Username is: "Â + username)
