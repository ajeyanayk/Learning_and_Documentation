<h1 align="center">Input Method</h1>

* We are able to Enter the input using *input()* <br />
	*Eg*:
```python
		  x=input("Enter Your name: ") 
		  print(x)  //it shows the content which we typed after execution
	
	//which display as 
	Enter username: 
```

* If we are using python version which is less than 3.6, we need to use `raw_input()` <br />
	*Eg*: 
```python
		username = raw_input("Enter username:") 
		  print("Username is: "Â + username) 

	//which display as
	Enter username:
```
