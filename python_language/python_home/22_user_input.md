#  Input Method

*We are able to Enter the input using* **input()** <br />
	*Eg*: ```x=input("Enter Your name: ")``` <br />
		  ```print(x)``` *it shows the content which we typed after execution*
	
	*which display as* <br />
	```Enter username:``` 

### If we are using python version which is less than 3.6, we need to use ```raw_input()``` <br />
	*Eg*: ```username = raw_input("Enter username:")``` <br />
		  ```print("Username is: "Â + username)``` <br />

	*which display as* <br />
	```Enter username:```
