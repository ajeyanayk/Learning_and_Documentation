Boolean represents only two values either "True" or "False"

When we are comparing  two values , the expression evaluated and returns the Boolean answer
	Eg:	print(82 < 25) # which returns the value as "False"
	  		print(15 == 50) # which returns the value as "False"
			print(25 > 14) # which returns the value as "True"

Evaluate Values and Variables
 bool() - the function which evaluate the expression and returns with value "True" or "False"
	Eg: print(bool("Ajeya")) # which displays True as the value is not empty

If string is not empty or number is not 0 or list, tuple, set, and dictionary except empty.

Only if empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0 and the value None or  0 evaluates to False.
