S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the Internet. Itâ€™s a simple storage service that offers an extremely durable, highly available, and infinitely scalable data storage infrastructure at very low costs.

S3 is also designed to be highly flexible. Store any type and amount of data that we want; read the same piece of data a million times or only for emergency disaster recovery; build a simple FTP application, or a sophisticated web application such as the Amazon.com retail web site. 

Amazon S3 provides a simple, standards-based REST web services interface that is designed to work with any Internet-development toolkit. The operations are intentionally made simple to make it easy to add new distribution protocols and functional layers
