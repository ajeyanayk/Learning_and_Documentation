* *Roles* - Collection of Policies (DB Read , DB Write)
* *Policies / Permission* -  Low level permission to resource (Allow & Deny)

	  * *Managed* - Which are built-in Policies in AWS <br />
      * *Customized* -  These policies are created by administrators , Which called as cloud Formation templates in jason <br />
