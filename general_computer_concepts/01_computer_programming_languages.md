<h1 align="center">Computer Programming Languages</h1> 

Programming languages are the languages which designed to communicate the instruction to the machine.

**There are three kind of programming languages**

1. **Machine Level Languages (Low Level Languages)**
	These are the languages which machine understands in the form of 0 or 1. In older days we need to give input  in the form of 0 or 1 so that machine understands.

2. **Assembly Level Languages**
    It is little easier than machine languages as it used the Mnemonics (Symbols or Number) to describe huge strings of 0 & 1, as the machine understands languages. A new device has been introduced "Assembler", which converts these Mnemonics into Machine Level Languages.
`Eg: MIPS, x86 etc`

3. **High Level Languages** 
These types of languages uses similar to Human Understandable statement or symbols and which are independent. Which are very smaller compare to other type of languages. Here Compiler  which converts these symbols or Statements to Machine Level Languages. 
`Eg: C, C++, java , python etc.`

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
It is software application which provides many useful facilities under single platform. Which consists of Source code editor , Compiler or interpreter and debugger and most of IDE are working on the all operating systems.

`Eg: Eclipse, PyDev, InteliJ, Visual Studio etc.`

* Eclipse & InteliJ : These are the popular develop tool for java development.
* PyDev : This is one of the development tool for Python Development.
* Android Studio : This the develop tool for Android development.
* Visual Studio Code: from Micorsoft
